# Developer Challenge

## Objective

The mobile app team needs your help. They are having a hard time making sure that they always assign a unique build number to each of their mobile app builds.
Your goal is to create a lightweight web service that will help automate the process by deciding what the next build number should be.


Create a HTML UI that that uses the REST API created in Task 1 to:

- Lookup the current build number for a given bundle identifier.
- Bump the build number for a given bundle identifier.
- Force set the build number for a given bundle identifier.

## Server

### Scripts:

1. Build scripts
   ```
   yarn build
